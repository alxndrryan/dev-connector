## Overview

DevConnector is a basic social media platform for developers. Users are able to register to the site, create a profile, and write posts and comments. The profile page includes the 
ability to fill out basic information about yourself such as your job experience and education. Additionally, user profiles can link to various social media websites they may have
such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Users can view their profile info on the dashboard page. The developers page displays every user registered to the website.
